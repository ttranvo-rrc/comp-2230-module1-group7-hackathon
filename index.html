            <p>
                Deep dish pizza is the best pizza in the world, 
            </p>
            <p>
                not because its from Chicago but because its deep.
                Deep meaning, deep toppings, deep cheese, deep sauce, deep soul. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you've ever wanted to experience a pizza rather
                than taste it, deep dish pizza is your go-to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deep-dish pizza is a thick-crust pizza, synonymous with Chicago, 
            </p>
            <p>
                that is baked in a round, deep pan, creating a pie-like structure with high, buttery crust edges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Characterized by layers of mozzarella cheese, toppings (like sausage), 
            </p>
            <p>
                and chunky tomato sauce, it features an "upside-down" construction with the cheese and toppings 
            </p>
            <p>
                at the bottom and the sauce on top. Often cooked in a cast-iron skillet, 
            </p>
            <p>
                it's a hearty dish that typically requires a knife and fork to eat due to its substantial, soft, and oozy filling.
            </p>

         <h2>Hawaiian Pizza</h2>
         <img src="hawaiianpizza.jpg" alt="Hawaiian Pizza" width="300" height="200">
         <p>As originated in Canada, the pineapple topped pizza has
            people on the divide for if it belongs or not. 

         <p>To be more specific, a Hawaiian pizza consists of the following:
         <ul>
                <li>Pineapples</li>
                <li>Cooked ham or bacon</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>It may be considered a bit controversial, which 
            causes debates from people around the world.
         </p>
         <p>Another thing about this so-called "Hawaiian" pizza is that
            pineapples are not native to Hawaii! However, the fruit became
            deeply tied with Hawaii's economy, identity, and culture, which 
            solidified its place in Hawaii.
         </p>
         <p>Even though this pizza is iffy on if it is good or bad, you never
            know until you try it.
