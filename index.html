         <h2>Hawaiian Pizza</h2>
         <img src="hawaiianpizza.jpg" alt="Hawaiian Pizza" width="300" height="200">
         <p>As originated in Canada, the pineapple topped pizza has
            people on the divide for if it belongs or not. 

         <p>To be more specific, a Hawaiian pizza consists of the following:
         <ul>
                <li>Pineapples</li>
                <li>Cooked ham or bacon</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>It may be considered a bit controversial, which 
            causes debates from people around the world.
         </p>
         <p>Another thing about this so-called "Hawaiian" pizza is that
            pineapples are not native to Hawaii! However, the fruit became
            deeply tied with Hawaii's economy, identity, and culture, which 
            solidified its place in Hawaii.
         </p>
         <p>Even though this pizza is iffy on if it is good or bad, you never
            know until you try it.
