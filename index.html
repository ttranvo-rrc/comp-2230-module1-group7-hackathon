            <p>
                Deep dish pizza is the best pizza in the world, 
            </p>
            <p>
                not because its from Chicago but because its deep.
                Deep meaning, deep toppings, deep cheese, deep sauce, deep soul. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you've ever wanted to experience a pizza rather
                than taste it, deep dish pizza is your go-to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deep-dish pizza is a thick-crust pizza, synonymous with Chicago, 
            </p>
            <p>
                that is baked in a round, deep pan, creating a pie-like structure with high, buttery crust edges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Characterized by layers of mozzarella cheese, toppings (like sausage), 
            </p>
            <p>
                and chunky tomato sauce, it features an "upside-down" construction with the cheese and toppings 
            </p>
            <p>
                at the bottom and the sauce on top. Often cooked in a cast-iron skillet, 
            </p>
            <p>
                it's a hearty dish that typically requires a knife and fork to eat due to its substantial, soft, and oozy filling.
            </p>
